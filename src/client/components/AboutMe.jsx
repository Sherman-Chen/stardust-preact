        <p><i className="fa fa-hand-peace-o icon"></i>When not developing I can usually be found exercising, playing tennis, binging netflix, or planning out my next personal project!</p>
        <p><i className="fa fa-university icon"></i>I'm dedicated to being a growth-oriented person and always learning new things. Something I've been learning recently is the Python web framework Django. Something I've been listening to recently is the awesome podcast <a className="link" href="http://frontendhappyhour.com/" target="_blank">Front End Happy Hour</a>.</p>
        <p><i className="fa fa-book icon"></i>I am a huge advocate for education reform and accessibility, having studied education, critical gender studies, and ethnic studies extensively at UCSD, and also volunteering time at local alternative education schools dedicated to serving disadvantaged and underrepresented youth.</p>
        <p><i className="fa fa-coffee icon"></i>I'm always excited with meeting new people and learning from them, let's get in <a href="/contact" className="link">touch</a> sometime over coffee or a meal!</p>
