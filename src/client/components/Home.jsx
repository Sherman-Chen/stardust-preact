          <h3><i className="fa fa-users icon"></i>I'm a Frontend Guy.</h3>
          <p>I love all things Frontend Engineering, writing awesome HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I especially enjoy using React and am quite the fanboy for Vue.js. I translate designs into reality, and make sure things look responsive and pretty across different browsers.</p>

          <h3><i className="fa fa-server icon"></i>I'm a Backend Guy.</h3>
          <p>I enjoy the server side as well! I write Node with Express, do Websocket stuff, and dabble in Python & Django for web development and APIs. I also muster the courage to perform SQL queries on occasion.</p>

          <h3><i className="fa fa-check-circle icon"></i>I'm a Testing Guy.</h3>
          <p>After all it's just as important as building the application. Mocha, and Chai aren't just tasty beverages to me. Protractor, Enzyme, and Jest aren't just words I would never use in everyday speech, although I do make use of Karma sometimes.</p>

          <h3><i className="fa fa-mobile icon"></i>Am I a Mobile Guy?</h3>
          <p>I've worked with React Native and Exponent before, and I'm always game for a challenge. I'm definitely a mobile first design approach guy though.</p>
